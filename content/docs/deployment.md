# ðŸš€ Deployment

Learn how to deploy your Hugo site to various hosting platforms and make it available to the world.

## Netlify (Recommended)

Netlify offers the easiest deployment experience with automatic builds from Git repositories.

{{% steps %}}

### Connect your repository

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Sign up for [Netlify](https://netlify.com) if you haven't already
3. Click "New site from Git" and connect your repository

### Configure build settings

Netlify should auto-detect Hugo, but you can manually set:

- **Build command**: `hugo --gc --minify`
- **Publish directory**: `public`
- **Hugo version**: Set in `netlify.toml` (already configured)

### Deploy

Click "Deploy site" and your site will be live in minutes!

{{% /steps %}}

The included `netlify.toml` file ensures optimal configuration:

```toml
[build]
publish = "public"
command = "hugo --gc --minify -b ${DEPLOY_PRIME_URL}"

[build.environment]
HUGO_VERSION = "0.147.7"
```

## Vercel

Vercel offers excellent performance and integration with Git providers.

{{% steps %}}

### Import project

1. Sign up for [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project" and import your Git repository
3. Vercel auto-detects Hugo and configures the build

### Custom configuration (optional)

Create a `vercel.json` file if you need custom settings:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "HUGO_VERSION": "0.147.7"
    }
  }
}
```

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

{{% steps %}}

### Build locally

Ensure your web server is configured to serve static files and handle clean URLs.

{{% /steps %}}

## Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain on Netlify

1. Go to your site's "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

### Custom Domain on Vercel

1. Go to your project's "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure your DNS records as instructed

### SSL/TLS

Most modern hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) provide automatic HTTPS certificates. For custom servers, consider using:

- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free SSL certificates
- Cloudflare for SSL proxy and CDN services

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Use Hugo's built-in image processing:

```markdown
{{< figure src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="800" height="600" >}}
```

### CDN Configuration

Most hosting platforms include CDN by default. For custom deployments, consider:

- Cloudflare (free tier available)
- AWS CloudFront
- KeyCDN

### Caching Headers

Configure appropriate caching headers for static assets:

```
# Netlify _headers file
/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000

/*.html
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Google Analytics

Add your tracking ID to `hugo.yaml`:

```yaml
googleAnalytics: "G-MEASUREMENT-ID"
```

### Performance Monitoring

- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest**: Free online testing tool
- **GTmetrix**: Performance analysis and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

{{< details title="Build fails with module errors" closed="true" >}}
Run `hugo mod tidy` to clean up module dependencies.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Styles not loading correctly" closed="true" >}}
Ensure PostCSS is processing your Tailwind CSS files correctly. Check that `build.writeStats` is enabled in `hugo.yaml`.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Images not displaying" closed="true" >}}
Verify image paths are correct relative to the `static/` directory.

> [!TIP]
> Always test your deployment locally with `hugo server` before pushing to production.

> [!NOTE]
> Different hosting platforms may have different build environments. Always check the platform's documentation for specific requirements.
