# Unsplash Image Finder

This skill helps find and optimize images from Unsplash for web content.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Creating web pages that need hero images, thumbnails, or content images
- User requests images for their website but doesn't provide specific URLs
- Building landing pages, blog posts, or documentation with visual content

## Search Command

Use the existing search script:

```bash
node dev-tools/unsplash-search.js "search keyword"
```

### Single Keyword Search
```bash
node dev-tools/unsplash-search.js "coffee shop"
```

### Multiple Keywords Search
```bash
node dev-tools/unsplash-search.js "technology,innovation,startup"
```

## URL Optimization Parameters

Unsplash URLs should be optimized with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Values |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `w` | Width in pixels | 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 1920 |
| `q` | Quality (1-100) | 80 (recommended) |
| `fm` | Format | webp (recommended), jpg, png |
| `fit` | Fit mode | crop (recommended) |

### Recommended Width by Usage

| Usage | Width | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Thumbnail | 400 | Cards, small previews |
| Content image | 800 | Blog posts, documentation |
| Large image | 1200 | Feature sections |
| Hero section | 1600 | Above-the-fold heroes |
| Full-width background | 1920 | Full-screen backgrounds |

### Optimized URL Format

```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?ixid=[ID]&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&w=[WIDTH]&q=80&fm=webp&fit=crop
```

## HTML Implementation

When inserting images, always include:

```html
<img
  src="[optimized-url]"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  class="[responsive-classes]"
>
```

### Required Attributes
- `alt`: Descriptive text for accessibility
- `loading="lazy"`: Defer loading for off-screen images
- `decoding="async"`: Non-blocking image decode

## Fallback Protocol

If the search fails, execute in order:

1. **Primary**: Try with original keyword
2. **Secondary**: Try broader/simpler keyword (e.g., "coffee" instead of "artisanal coffee shop interior")
3. **Tertiary**: Ask user for specific image URL or preference
4. **NEVER**: Guess or hallucinate Unsplash URLs from training data

## Error Handling

If the search script returns an error:
1. Check that `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` is set in `.env.local` or environment
2. Try with a different/simpler keyword
3. Report the error to the user

## Environment Setup

The search script requires:
- Node.js
- `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable

See `.env.local.example` for reference.

## Example Workflow

1. **Receive request**: "Add a hero image for a tech startup page"
2. **Search**: `node dev-tools/unsplash-search.js "tech startup office"`
3. **Get result**: Script returns optimized URL
4. **Apply to code**:
   ```html
   <img
     src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?w=1600&q=80&fm=webp&fit=crop"
     alt="Modern tech startup office with team collaboration"
     loading="lazy"
     decoding="async"
     class="w-full h-auto object-cover"
   >
   ```

## Important Notes

- This skill ONLY searches and provides URLs - it does NOT modify files
- File modifications are handled by Claude Code main conversation
- Always verify URLs work before using them
- Respect Unsplash API usage guidelines
